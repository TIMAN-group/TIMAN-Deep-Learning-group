# TIMAN-Deep-Learning-group
This repository contains the schedule, presentations and readings for the TIMAN UIUC Deep Learning Group.
- If you have any papers you'd like to discuss, please make a pull request or send an email to lourent2 and we'll add it. 
- Papers accompanied with their implementations are encouraged.
- Members that present are welcome to upload the slides, preferably before the weekly meeting.
- Meetings will primarily focus on discussion of our work and potentially share 2-3 papers each week

## Notes on suggesting papers
When selecting a paper, it is beneficial to consider these points: 
- Is this an influential work that will likely change our thinking? (e.g., GANs)
- Among all of the new papers in DL/Seq2Seq/.. which ones are most promising and might open new paths or generate new ideas?
- Will this be of interest to most members of this DL group?
